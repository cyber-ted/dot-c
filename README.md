# Dot-c - My 'C' Journey 

This is my effort to effort to document my journey where I learn C. 

## Hierarchy 

- The ./src directory contains my sample code I use to implement the things I have learnt; it compiles into ./bin

### Commands 
	make -> HELP INFORMATION
	make c1 -> MAKE main.c FROM SECTION 1
	make clean-c1 -> TO CLEAN UP BINARIES OF SECTION 1
	make run-C2 -> To run the compiled binary OF SECTION 1

- The ./examples directory contains actual demos, each sub directory in the ./examples directory contains a Makefile to compile, clean-up and make-&-store a binary of the program 

### Commands 
	make -> MAKE THE BINARY
	make clean -> CLEAN UP 
	make binary -> MAKE THE BINARY; COPY IT TO ../bin 

## Who is this repo for?! 

This repo is for anyone who wants a reference or summary for the functanalities of the C language.
Also, this can be useful to a new-comer; wanting a general idea about C.

## SOURCES 

I learn C from EssentialC.pdf. Just a shout out! :) 

## Conclusion 

Stay Motivated and F.O.C.U.S!!!
